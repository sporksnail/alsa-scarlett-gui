+.SH NAME
+	\fBalsa-scarlett-gui\fP \- Gtk4 GUI for the ALSA controls presented by the Focusrite Scarlett/Clarett kernel driver
+.
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.SY alsa-scarlett-gui
+.RI [ FILE ]
+.YS
+.
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+	\fBalsa-scarlett-gui\fP is a Gtk4 GUI for the ALSA controls presented by the Linux kernel Focusrite Scarlett Gen 2/3/Clarett USB/Clarett+ Mixer Driver.
+.sp
+	The Focusrite USB audio interfaces are class compliant meaning that they work "out of the box" on Linux as audio and MIDI interfaces (although on Gen 3 you need to disable MSD mode first for full functionality). However, except for some of the smallest models, they have a bunch of proprietary functionality that required a kernel driver to be written specifically for those devices.
+.sp
+	Linux kernel support ("ALSA Focusrite Scarlett Gen 2/3 Mixer Driver") for the proprietary functionality was first added in:
+.sp
+.IP \[bu]
+Scarlett Gen 2: Linux 5.4 (bugs fixed in Linux 5.14)

+Scarlett Gen 3: Linux 5.14
+.IP \[bu]
+Clarett+ 8Pre: Linux 6.1
+.IP \[bu]
+Clarett 2Pre/4Pre/8Pre USB, Clarett+ 2Pre/4Pre: coming soon

+.SH BUGS
+.IP \[bu]
+The linear-dB scale of the volume controls doesn't work well. Lower volumes (e.g. below -30dB) don't need as much fine control as higher volumes.
+.IP \[bu]
+Canâ€™t select (focus) the gain/volume controls or use a keyboard to adjust them.
+.IP \[bu]
+Level (monitoring) doesn't work yet and is disabled (needs kernel driver update).
+.IP \[bu]
+Load/Save uses alsactl which will be confused if the ALSA interface name (e.g. USB) changes.
+.IP \[bu]
+Load/Save is not implemented for simulated interfaces.
+.IP \[bu]
+Lots of "couldn't find weak ref" warnings are emitted when loading a state file for simulation.
+.IP \[bu]
+The read-only status of controls in interface simulation mode does not change when the HW/SW button is clicked.
+.IP \[bu]
+When there's more than one main window open, closing one of them doesn't free and close everything related to that card.
+.IP \[bu]
+There is no facility to group channels into stereo pairs (needs kernel support to save this information in the interface).
+.IP \[bu]
+There is no facility to give channels custom names (needs kernel support to save this information in the interface).
+.IP \[bu]
+No keyboard accelerators (e.g. Ctrl\-Q to quit) have been implemented.
